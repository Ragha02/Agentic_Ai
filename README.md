# 🧠 Agentic AI - Makers Lab (Hyderabad)

repository of **Agentic AI**, an innovative research and development initiative by the Makers Lab in Hyderabad.
## 🚀 What We’re Working On

We are currently developing and implementing protocols for advanced multi-agent systems. Our focus areas include:

### 🤝 A2A: Agent-to-Agent Communication
A robust communication framework enabling autonomous agents to interact, collaborate, and make decisions in decentralized environments.

- Supports asynchronous and real-time messaging
- Semantic understanding powered by LLM backends
- Event-driven interactions and behavior trees
- Use of fast language models (e.g., Groq API for ultra-low latency)

### 🧩 ACP: Agent Control Protocol
ACP defines how agents are created, controlled, and terminated in the system.

- Lifecycle management of agents
- Role-based control (e.g., Supervisor Agent, Worker Agent)
- Secure initiation and shutdown sequences
- Audit and logging for agent actions

### 🌐 MCP: Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol
MCP is designed to ensure synchronized task execution and efficient decision-making across multiple agents.

- Task allocation strategies (e.g., bidding, auction-based, round robin)
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Consensus formation
- Shared memory and context propagation

## 💡 Vision

Our goal is to enable fully autonomous, decentralized agent systems that can:
- Function collaboratively in real-world domains (e.g., healthcare, customer support)
- Self-organize and adapt in dynamic environments
- Integrate seamlessly with APIs, databases, and real-time data sources
